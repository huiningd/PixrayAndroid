Android program for viewing and grading scientific pictures. 
The program fetches the following data from remote server: 
project list, plate list for a single project, pictures of a single plate, and related information of each picture. 
Data is retrieved through REST API. Data transfer is done by using Volley.

The app was done in 2015 when I was first time learning Android. It is already rendered obsolete due to the fast development in Android world.
